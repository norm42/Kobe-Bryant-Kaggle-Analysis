We have removed 5000 of the shot_made_flags (represented as missing values in the csv file). These are the test set shots for which you must submit a prediction. You are provided a sample submission file with the correct shot_ids needed for a valid prediction.

To avoid leakage, your method should only train on events that occurred prior to the shot for which you are predicting! Since this is a playground competition with public answers, it's up to you to abide by this rule.

The field names are self explanatory and contain the following attributes:

    action_type
    combined_shot_type
    game_event_id
    game_id
    lat
    loc_x
    loc_y
    lon
    minutes_remaining
    period
    playoffs
    season 
    seconds_remaining
    shot_distance
    shot_made_flag (this is what you are predicting)
    shot_type
    shot_zone_area
    shot_zone_basic
    shot_zone_range
    team_id
    team_name
    game_date
    matchup
    opponent
    shot_id


Game_ID is the nba.com ID for that game. The Game_Event_ID is the event or play ID of that particular shot within the game (or Game_ID). These event ID's aren't limited to the player but rather every event that took place in the given game.

You are correct on lat and lon. loc_x and loc_y are the coordinates on the court where the shot took place. The court is 94x50 and they track shot location by using a scale from -250 to 250 for loc_x (negatives to differentiate which side of the basket) and loc_y goes -50-890 (most shots are from less than 400 since that would be forty feet in longitude away from the basket; negatives to account for the space "behind" the basket). See some of the exploratory analyses for how these have been used.

Minutes_remaining and seconds_remaining are the minutes and seconds remaining in that quarter so you could aggregate them to get the time left in the quarter. There are 12 minutes in periods 1-4 and 5 in each of 5-7.

Which leads to period... Periods 1-4 are the 4 quarters of regulation time. Period 5 is the first overtime (OT), period 6 the second OT, and period 7 the third OT. If you do a histogram of shots by period you'll see that very few shots were taken in periods 6 and 7 because not many games go to double and triple overtime.
