# Kobe-Bryant-Kaggle-Analysis
A data analysis and modeling done with the Kaggle Kobe Bryant data set.

This is some experimental work I did with the Kobe Bryant data set from Kaggle.  The R files and presentation I did locally 
are included in this repository.  I did not include the data set here as it is property of Kaggle.  You will have to 
go to the Kaggle site to get the data.
